# Automation

There are few ways to automate the usage of the Terminal.

## Executing Commands

You can execute a command just like the user typed a command:

```javascript
const term = $('body').terminal({
  echo(arg) {
      this.echo(arg.toUpperCase());
  }
});

term.exec('echo hello');
```

this will show the output:

```
> echo hello
HELLO
```

Just as user typed this command, it will show the prompt and command. Internaly this is
called "echo command". You can also exeucute the command but don't show the command that
you executed (without echo command).

```javascript
const term = $('body').terminal();

term.exec('echo hello', true);
```

This will output just text:

```
HELLO
```

The second argument can also be an object with option:

```javascript
const term = $('body').terminal();

term.exec('command', { silent: true });
```

This is needed when using animation, where you need to put more options. The boolean
`silent` parameter is an old API, but to not creating a breaking change the old behavior
is supported together with object.


## Echo Command Without Execution

You can also just echo the command without executing the command.

```javascript
const term = $('body').terminal();

term.enter('command');
```
