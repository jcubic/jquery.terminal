# Terminal Instance

Terminal instance is the main API that allow you to interact with the jQuery Terminal library. To
access the terminal instance you can use return value from terminal call. Or access it with `this`
keyword inside methods.

```javascript
const term = $('body').terminal({
    echo(...args) {
        this.echo(args.join(' '));
    }
}, {
    checkArity: false,
    greetings: false
});

term.echo('Welcome to my terminal');
```

In above code we call `echo()` method on terminal instance in `term` constant.  We also use
`this.echo` to implement `echo` command.

## Common Tasks

Here is a list of most common task you can use with the Terminal. The full list of methods are in
[Reference Guide](#???).

### Print Text on the Terminal

To print the text you use the `echo()` method. The first argument is a value that you want to echo
and the second are options. More about echo method in [What you can echo?](/docs/deep-dive/echo)
Guide.

### Changing the Command
To change the current command you can use `set_command()` method:

```javascript
term.set_command('hello world);
```

### Inserting Text Into the Command

You can also modify the command by inserting text at given cursor position, with `term.insert('text');`.
You can change the cursor position and then insert the string.

```javascript
term.set_command('heworld');
term.set_position(2);
term.insert('llo ');
```

### Getting The Command

To get the current command, you can use `get_command()` method.

<CodePen id="MYYaYoO" title="get_command" />

### Clear the Terminal

To clear the terminal you use `clear()` method or default `clear` command. To remove this default command.
You can use `clear: false` option, as second argument to the terminal.

```javascript
const term = $('body').terminal({}, {
  clear: false
});

term.clear();
```

### Destroy the Terminal

To destroy the terminal and clean the DOM, you can use `destroy()` method.

### Reading Text from User

To read the data from the user you can use Nested Interpreter, or a syntax sugar in form of
`read()` method. It returns a promise that resolve into the command the user type:

```javascript
term.read('name: ').then(name => {
  term.echo(`Your name is ${name}`);
});
```
