# Terminal Instance

Terminal instance is the main API that allow you to interact with the jQuery Terminal library. To
access the terminal instance you can use return value from terminal call. Or access it with `this`
keyword inside methods.

```javascript
const term = $('body').terminal({
    echo(...args) {
        this.echo(args.join(' '));
    }
}, {
    checkArity: false,
    greetings: false
});

term.echo('Welcome to my terminal');
```

In above code you code we disabled the terminal and call echo on terminal instance in `term`
constant.  We also use `this.echo(...)` to implement `echo` command.

## Common Tasks

Here is a list of most common task you can use with the Terminal. The full list of methos is in
[Reference Guide](#???).

### Print Text on the Terminal

To print the text you use the `echo` method. The first argument is a value that you want to echo and
the second are options. More about echo method in [What you can echo?](/docs/deep-dive/echo) Guide.

### Inserting Text Into the Command

To insert text into the command you can use `term.insert('text');`. You need to call this method outside of interpreter.
You can do this outside of terminal, or inside an event, see [Terminal Events](#???).

This function insert the text at current cursor position. You can change the position and then insert.

```javascript
term.set_command('heworld');
term.set_position(2);
term.insert('llo ');
```
