# Getting Started

## Introduction

jQuery Terminal is a JavaScript library that requires jQuery to work properly. It's a library that
allow you to create terminal based web apps. It's different from
[xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/), because you need to write your whole logic in
client JavaScript code. In comparison, Xterm.js is a library to create a real terminal interface for
a real Linux system on the backend. It allows running a real
[CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)/[TUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface)
applications like VI that run on the backend.  To have the same in jQuery Terminal you will need to
have a VI implemented in JavaScript. For this you can check [jsvi](https://github.com/jcubic/jsvi).


To create an app using jQuery Terminal, first, you need to create an HTML page, and then include
jQuery and both the JavaScript and CSS files from jQuery Terminal. You can also use [webpack or other
bundlers](#???). In this tutorial, you will learn all the basics needed to create your own
Terminal on a webpage.

## jsDelivr CDN

The best way to get jQuery Terminal is using [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/), it's CDN (Content Delivery Network),
that makes loading static assets (like JavaScript or CSS files) faster.

Those are main files that you need to include:

* `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery.terminal@2.x.x/js/jquery.terminal.min.js`
* `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery.terminal@2.x.x/css/jquery.terminal.min.css`

## HTML page

Below is basic HTML code that you need:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery.terminal/js/jquery.terminal.min.js">
</script>
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery.terminal/css/jquery.terminal.min.css"
      rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
<body>
<scrpt>/* your code here */</script>
</body>
</html>
```

The version `@2.x.x` is optional.

:::note
You can write your code inline like in the code above, or write separate file and use HTML like this:
```html
<script src="your-file.js"></script>
```
:::

## Older browsers

If you need to support older browsers (like IE11) you can also include this JavaScript file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/js-polyfills/keyboard.js"></script>
```

It's a polyfill for key property on keyboard events. You can see the
[browser support for this feature](https://caniuse.com/keyboardevent-key).

## Chinese and Japanese character support

There are characters like Chinese and Japanese that are wider then 1 character. To display those
characters properly on the terminal you can use [wcwidth](https://github.com/timoxley/wcwidth) libary,
which calculates the width of the characters.

You can add this code to your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jcubic/static/js/wcwidth.js"></script>
```

Above file is a collection of libraries converted to [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) using
browserify.


## Terminal Initialization

To initialize the terminal you need to use code like this:

```javascript
$('body').terminal();
```

Above code is specific to jQuery. If you're not familar with it, it's basically dolar function that accept a CSS selector
that points to element that will be transformed into your terminal. When you use `body` as the selector, it will create
full screen terminal. But you can also use element that is part of your webpage, like a
[window that have a terminal inside](#???).

## Interpreter

The first argument to the terminal is an interpreter, the simplest way to add multiple commands is using an object.

```javascript
$('body').terminal({
    hello() {
        this.echo('hello, world!');
    },
    bye() {
        this.echo('goodby');
    }
});
```

This code will create two commands:
* `hello` which prints on the terminal text `"hello, world!"`,
* `bye` which prints `"goodby"`

To create arguments to the commands you add them as function paramters:

```javascript
$('body').terminal({
    hello(what) {
        this.echo(`hello, this is ${what}!`);
    },
    bye() {
        this.echo('goodby');
    }
});
```

If you type `hello Terminal` it will print "hello, this is Terminal"

## Terminal Options

### Variable number of arguments

If you want the argument to be optional you need to `checkArity: false` option (options is an object
that is a second argumnet to the termianal). Variable number of arguments is so called
[Arity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity).

```javascript
$('body').terminal({
    hello(what = 'world') {
        this.echo(`hello, this is ${what}!`);
    },
    bye() {
        this.echo('goodby');
    }
}, {
    checkArity: false
});
```

### Greetings

Another usefull option that you want to change is `greetings`, by default it display jQuery Terminal
[ASCII Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art), but you can change it.

```javascript
$('body').terminal({
    hello(what = 'world') {
        this.echo(`hello, this is ${what}!`);
    },
    bye() {
        this.echo('goodby');
    }
}, {
    greetings: 'My Terminal',
    checkArity: false
});
```

### Prompt

You can also change the prompt, which is the thing before the cursor, when there is no command typed yet.
By default it's a string `'> '`. But you can change it and use different string:

```javascript
$('body').terminal({
    hello(what = 'world') {
        this.echo(`hello, this is ${what}!`);
    },
    bye() {
        this.echo('goodby');
    }
}, {
    greetings: 'My Terminal',
    prompt: '$ ',
    checkArity: false
});
```

### Completion

By default when you press `<TAB>` key, the terminal will insert a `TAB` key. You can make it complete the command,
you're typing. When using object as an interpreter (like in above examples) all you have to do is to set an option:
`completion: true`:

```javascript
$('body').terminal({
    hello(what = 'world') {
        this.echo(`hello, this is ${what}!`);
    },
    bye() {
        this.echo('goodby');
    }
}, {
    greetings: 'My Terminal',
    prompt: '$ ',
    completion: true,
    checkArity: false
});
```

If you type `h` and press `<TAB>` it will complete the command and insert `ello`.
